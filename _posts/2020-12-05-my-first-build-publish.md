My first application build. This is a web browser. It is not fully functional but it can open some websites. This is not like Internet explorer. Since, it is not optimized for the web, it is slow and may not work with some websites.

<form action="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheAwesomeCoder05/builds/main/WebBrowser-20201205T150036Z-001.zip">

<!-- Add icon library -->

<!-- Auto width -->
<button class="btn" style="width:100%"><i class="fa fa-download"></i> Download</button>
